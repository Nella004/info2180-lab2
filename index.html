                <h2>Feeling Small</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">September 24, 2024 by Jhanel</p>

                <p>I believe everyone has their own case of imposter syndrome, where they dont feel they are qualified 
                    enough to do or give advice on something. Especially in this field, theres so many ways to do the same 
                    thing and not enough time to learn all of them. Nowadays, a passion for technology or computers cannot 
                    carry you through this line of work. The passion is important as a means of motivation but without the 
                    perseverance to learn all that it comes with, it turns into an unreachable question of What if?
                </p>
                <p>It is not an easy passion to pursue, but the thrill of accomplishment felt after producing through
                    yours and only your efforts is a feeling like no other. Finding that one missing semi colon that 
                    fixes your entire code is the same as winning the olympics. This also goes for all careers, there's 
                    always going to be someone who knows more, learns quicker and performs better but that does not take 
                    away the capabilities of your skills
                </p>

                <h2>The AI Takeover</h2>
                <p class="post-meta">October 5, 2024 by Jhanel</p>
                <img src="https://east.vc/news/insights/artificial-intelligence-in-indonesia-the-current-state-and-its-opportunities/" alt="Second Blog Post Image" class="post-image">
                <p>There's this course offered in CSEC called Electronic Document Preparation and Management, which is essentially
                    just typing and other basic computer skills. At first, based on how long it has been offered for I thought it 
                    was probably useful when people were still adjusting to the technology, especially a third world country like
                    Jamaica. Now I wonder if those, who took the course felt it was a waste due to the volume of technological
                    advancement the world has and continues to gain. My mom is an accountant, and I constantly hear of how their 
                    purpose in society is decreasing at a threatening level. People can now go online and do things that they would 
                    normally need to do in person.
                </p>
                <p> As I computer science student, I dont necessarily believe the narrative "AI is taking over", however, I do believe
                    that people are losing a way of income due to the products being continuously ad rapidly developed on a daily basis.
                    IT has been made a compulsory subject, due to the fact that more and more things are done or somehow connected 
                    to the use of computers. The resolution? Im not sure there is one because the world cannot and will not stop developing.
                    It is just up to the older generation to help those below them adapt to the everchanging society.
